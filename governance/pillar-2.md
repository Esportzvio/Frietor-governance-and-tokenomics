## **Pillar 2 - System Smart Contracts Governance**

### **Upgrade Classification**

Smart contract governance within the Frietor blockchain involves a classification of upgrades into two main types: Regular and Emergency.

1. **Regular Upgrades:**
   - Regular upgrades are part of a scheduled and planned process. They encompass improvements, optimizations, or enhancements to the smart contracts of the Frietor blockchain. These upgrades are crucial for the ongoing development and evolution of the system.

2. **Emergency Upgrades:**
   - Emergency upgrades address critical vulnerabilities, exploits, or issues that pose an immediate threat to the network's health and security. Unlike regular upgrades, emergency upgrades are unscheduled and aim to swiftly resolve urgent issues.

### **Timelocks & Security**

Timelocks play a pivotal role in ensuring the security and integrity of the Frietor network during the upgrade process.

1. **Regular Upgrades:**
   - Timelocks are employed before the implementation of regular upgrades. This time delay allows token holders to assess the proposed changes, exit the protocol if they disagree with the upgrade, or veto potentially malicious upgrades.

2. **Emergency Upgrades:**
   - Emergency upgrades, by their nature, require rapid intervention. To be considered an emergency, a supermajority consensus (e.g., 9 out of 12 council members) from the Frietor Ecosystem Council is necessary. This consensus ensures that emergency upgrades are executed swiftly in response to critical issues.

### **Ecosystem Council**

The Frietor Ecosystem Council is a key governance body responsible for overseeing both regular and emergency upgrades. Comprising 12 members, the Council acts in the interest of the Frietor ecosystem and operates through a multi-signature wallet.

#### **Council Responsibilities:**
1. **Executing Regular Upgrades:**
   - The Council is responsible for executing planned and scheduled regular upgrades, ensuring the continued development of the Frietor blockchain.

2. **Executing Emergency Upgrades:**
   - In the event of critical vulnerabilities or exploits, the Council swiftly executes emergency upgrades to protect the network.

3. **Transparency Reporting:**
   - The Council provides transparency to the community through Council Autopsy Reports for emergency upgrades and Council Transparency Reports for regular upgrades. These reports detail the reasoning, actions taken, and outcomes of each upgrade.

#### **Council Membership:**
   - The Council is composed of representatives from diverse parts of the Frietor ecosystem. Community members have the ability to modify the Council membership by removing existing members and proposing new ones, ensuring ongoing representation.

### **Voting Power**

To align incentives and enhance governance, a voting power system is under exploration within the Frietor ecosystem.

1. **Locking Tokens:**
   - Users can lock tokens for defined periods, with longer lock-ups resulting in higher voting power. This mechanism incentivizes long-term commitment and aligns the interests of token holders with the sustained success of the protocol.

2. **Token Utility:**
   - The tokens used for governance purposes can also be utilized to secure the network at the protocol layer, promoting a dual-use case for the native token.

3. **Delegating Tokens:**
   - Token holders have the flexibility to delegate some or all of their tokens and can un-delegate at any time. This feature enhances participation and governance flexibility.

### **Voting Process**

The governance voting process is integral to decision-making regarding upgrades within the Frietor ecosystem.

1. **Community Voting Window:**
   - A community voting window opens whenever an upgrade is queued for timelock by the Council.

2. **Automatic Execution:**
   - If there is no majority opposition during the voting window, the upgrade is automatically executed after the timelock has ended.

3. **Cancellation in Case of Opposition:**
   - If the quorum is met for majority opposition, the upgrade is canceled, reflecting the importance of community consensus in major governance decisions.
