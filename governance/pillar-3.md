## **Pillar 3 - Community Treasury Governance**

### **Community Treasury Board**

The Community Treasury Board plays a pivotal role in governing the funds allocated to the Frietor ecosystem, supporting projects and public goods. The objective is to ensure the sustained growth and innovation within the Frietor ecosystem.

#### **Responsibilities:**
1. **Fund Allocation:**
   - The Community Treasury Board is responsible for overseeing the allocation of funds from the community treasury. This includes funding projects, initiatives, and public goods that contribute to the development and enrichment of the Frietor ecosystem.

2. **Ecosystem Growth:**
   - The board focuses on initiatives that promote the growth of the ecosystem. This involves identifying and supporting projects that align with the overall vision and goals of Frietor.

### **Nominations**

The process of selecting members for the initial Community Treasury Board involves active participation from the Frietor community.

1. **Open Nominations:**
   - The Frietor community is invited to participate in nominating members for the initial Community Treasury Board. This open nomination process ensures representation from diverse perspectives within the community.

2. **Board Composition:**
   - The board is composed of individuals selected from the community, chosen for their commitment to the collective growth of the Frietor ecosystem. The composition may evolve over time to ensure ongoing relevance and diversity.

### **Transparency**

Open communication and transparency are core principles in the governance of the Community Treasury.

1. **Periodic Reports:**
   - The Community Treasury Board proposes the creation of periodic board transparency reports. These reports provide insights into the board's decisions, fund allocations, and overall governance activities. They serve to keep the community informed and engaged.

2. **Open-Sourced Dashboard:**
   - An open-sourced dashboard is proposed to accompany transparency reports. This dashboard enhances accessibility and visibility, allowing the community to track and understand how funds are utilized.

### **Community Participation**

The governance model encourages increasing community responsibility and authority in decision-making processes.

1. **Initial Council Oversight:**
   - In the initial stages, a council of ecosystem members oversees the distribution of funds on-chain. This ensures transparency throughout the process and establishes a foundation for responsible fund management.

2. **Evolution to Community-Led Governance:**
   - The overarching framework is geared towards a phased transition to community-led allocation of funds, project selection, voting, and implementation. This evolution may be facilitated by innovative governance models as the community matures.

### **Explicit Community Governance**

The Frietor community consists of diverse stakeholders, including token holders, delegators, contributors, and validators.

1. **Balancing Stakeholder Opinions:**
   - Balancing the opinions of all stakeholders is crucial. The proposal suggests exploring novel voting mechanisms, such as quadratic voting and reputation-based voting, to ensure a fair and representative decision-making process.

### **Project Selection**

The Community Treasury Board is actively involved in selecting and supporting projects that contribute to the public good and ecosystem development.

1. **Review Process:**
   - Initially, the board collects and reviews all Frietor Funding Proposals (FFPs) submitted by the community. The review process involves evaluating project feasibility, impact, and alignment with the ecosystem's goals.

2. **Community Involvement:**
   - As the governance model matures, the process of review and selection may evolve to include more direct community involvement. The board serves as a security gateway for funds, while the community provides feedback and proposes parameters for evaluating public goods and ecosystem projects.

### **Tokenomics**

The Community Treasury is funded by a predetermined emission of FRT (Frietor native token). The emission rate is proposed to be 1% per year, or approximately 100 million FRT in absolute terms. This emission rate is set for 10 years, guaranteeing strong ecosystem support critical for development and growth.
