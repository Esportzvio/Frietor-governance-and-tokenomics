# Frietor Governance and Tokenomics Proposal

## Introduction

Welcome to the Frietor Governance and Tokenomics Proposal, a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate decentralized governance and sustainable development of the Frietor blockchain. This proposal is inspired by the governance model of Polygon and introduces three fundamental pillars: Protocol Governance, System Smart Contracts Governance, and Community Treasury Governance.

## **Pillar 1 - Protocol Governance**

### FIP Framework

The Frietor Improvement Proposal (FIP) framework serves as the cornerstone for open-source maintenance and development. FIPs are categorized into four types: Core, Contracts, Interface, and Informational. The framework aims to streamline coordination and consensus around upgrades efficiently.

## **Pillar 2 - System Smart Contracts Governance**

### Upgrade Classification

Smart contract upgrades are classified into two types: Regular and Emergency. The governance process involves breaking down upgrades into mutually-exclusive and collectively-exhaustive components.

### Timelocks & Security

Timelocks play a pivotal role in the network's security. Regular upgrades follow a scheduled process, while emergency upgrades address critical vulnerabilities. A supermajority consensus from the Frietor Ecosystem Council is required for emergency upgrades.

### Ecosystem Council

The Frietor Ecosystem Council consists of 12 members representing diverse parts of the ecosystem. The council executes regular and emergency upgrades, ensuring transparency through Autopsy or Transparency Reports. Community modification of council membership is facilitated.

### Voting Power

To align incentives and introduce conviction-based governance, a vote escrow system is under exploration. Users can lock tokens for varying periods, with longer lock-ups resulting in higher voting power.

### Voting Process

Community voting occurs during upgrade timelocks. If there is no majority opposition, the upgrade is automatically executed after the timelock ends. If the quorum is met for majority opposition, the upgrade is canceled.

## **Pillar 3 - Community Treasury Governance**

### Community Treasury Board

A proposed Community Treasury Board oversees funds for projects and public goods, ensuring the ecosystem's continued growth. The community is invited to participate in nominating board members for collective governance.

### Transparency

Regular board transparency reports and an open-sourced dashboard are proposed to enhance communication and accountability between the Community Treasury Board and the community.

### Community Participation

The proposal aims to gradually increase the community's responsibility and authority in the decision-making process. Initially, a council oversees fund distribution, evolving toward community-led allocation facilitated by innovative governance models.

### Explicit Community Governance

Balancing the opinions of different stakeholders requires exploring novel voting mechanisms, such as quadratic voting and reputation-based voting.

### Project Selection

The board reviews and selects projects initially, with plans for evolving to enable more direct community involvement. Community feedback guides parameters for evaluating public goods and ecosystem projects.

### Tokenomics

As outlined in the Tokenomics Whitepaper, the Community Treasury is funded by a predetermined emission of FRT. The emission rate proposed is 1% per year, or â‰ˆ100 million FRT in absolute terms, and cannot be changed for 10 years.

## **FIP Protocol**

A framework enabling formal participation in the funding process, similar to how the FIP framework serves protocol governance. Frietor Funding Proposals (FFPs) would be publicly available, accessible, and submittable by anyone, giving the community a means of communication with the community board.

This comprehensive governance and tokenomics proposal aim to foster transparency, community engagement, and sustainable growth within the Frietor ecosystem. We invite the Frietor community to review and contribute to this evolving framework.
