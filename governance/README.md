# Frietor Governance and Tokenomics Proposal

## Introduction

Welcome to the Frietor Governance and Tokenomics Proposal, a robust framework inspired by the proven governance model of Polygon. This proposal introduces three pillars: Protocol Governance, System Smart Contracts Governance, and Community Treasury Governance, designed to foster decentralized governance and sustainable development within the Frietor blockchain. We acknowledge and credit Polygon for their innovative approach to governance, which has influenced the structure of Frietor's governance model ([Polygon Governance Pillars](https://polygon.technology/governance-pillars)).

## **Pillar 1 - Protocol Governance**

### FIP Framework

The Frietor Improvement Proposal (FIP) framework is the bedrock of open-source maintenance and development. Categorized into Core, Contracts, Interface, and Informational, FIPs streamline coordination and consensus around upgrades efficiently, drawing inspiration from the successful Polygon model.

---

## **Pillar 2 - System Smart Contracts Governance**

### Upgrade Classification

Smart contract upgrades are classified into Regular and Emergency, reflecting Polygon's approach to systematically managing upgrades for efficiency and security.

### Timelocks & Security

Timelocks play a critical role in enhancing network security, aligning with the practices employed by Polygon. Regular and Emergency upgrades undergo a meticulous process, ensuring community safety.

### Ecosystem Council

The Frietor Ecosystem Council, mirroring Polygon's governance structure, comprises 12 members from diverse ecosystem segments. Their responsibility includes executing upgrades transparently and allowing community modification of council membership.

### Voting Power

A dynamic voting power system, under exploration, aligns with Polygon's commitment to fair and representative governance. This system incentivizes long-term commitment and active participation.

### Voting Process

Community-driven voting during upgrade timelocks ensures democratic decision-making. This process, inspired by Polygon's governance, promotes inclusivity and consensus building.

## **Pillar 3 - Community Treasury Governance**

### Community Treasury Board

The proposed Community Treasury Board mirrors Polygon's success in governing funds for projects and public goods, fostering continued ecosystem growth.

### Transparency

Regular board transparency reports and an open-sourced dashboard enhance communication and accountability, echoing the transparency practices of Polygon's governance.

### Community Participation

The gradual increase in community responsibility and authority aligns with Polygon's philosophy, aiming for a future where the community leads allocation and decision-making processes.

### Explicit Community Governance

Innovative voting mechanisms like quadratic voting and reputation-based voting, inspired by Polygon, are explored to balance stakeholder opinions effectively.

### Project Selection

The board's initial role in reviewing and selecting projects aligns with Polygon's approach, with plans for increased direct community involvement as the governance model evolves.

### Tokenomics

The emission-based funding for the Community Treasury, with a predetermined rate and a commitment period, draws inspiration from Polygon's successful tokenomics strategy.

---

## **FIP Protocol**

The proposed Frietor Funding Proposals (FFPs) protocol, allowing formal community participation in the funding process, draws inspiration from Polygon's proven framework, fostering communication and collaboration.

---

This comprehensive governance and tokenomics proposal aim to build upon the successful principles of Polygon's governance model, tailored for the Frietor ecosystem. We invite the Frietor community to review, contribute, and shape the evolution of this framework.

_Note: The Frietor governance model is based on the current governance model of Polygon, and due credit is given to Polygon for their innovative approach to decentralized governance ([Polygon Governance Pillars](https://polygon.technology/governance-pillars))._
