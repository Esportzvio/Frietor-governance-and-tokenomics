## **Pillar 1 - Protocol Governance**

### **FIP Framework**

The Frietor Improvement Proposal (FIP) framework is the foundation for decentralized governance of the Frietor blockchain protocol. It is designed to facilitate open-source maintenance, development, and upgrades through a structured and transparent process. The FIP framework categorizes proposals into four main types:

1. **Core FIPs:**
   - These proposals address changes and upgrades to the core protocol of Frietor. They may include modifications to consensus mechanisms, network parameters, or fundamental protocol features.

2. **Contracts FIPs:**
   - Contracts FIPs focus on proposed changes or enhancements to the smart contracts that form the backbone of the Frietor blockchain. This category covers upgrades and optimizations to the existing smart contract infrastructure.

3. **Interface FIPs:**
   - Interface FIPs pertain to changes in the user interface (UI) or user experience (UX) aspects of Frietor. These proposals may involve improvements to wallets, explorer interfaces, or other user-facing components.

4. **Informational FIPs:**
   - Informational FIPs are non-binding proposals that provide information, guidelines, or general recommendations. They do not introduce changes to the protocol but are essential for conveying information to the community.

### **FIP Lifecycle:**

1. **Proposal Submission:**
   - Anyone from the Frietor community can submit a FIP. Proposals are submitted through a defined process, including a template specifying the details of the proposed change or upgrade.

2. **Discussion and Feedback:**
   - Submitted FIPs undergo a community discussion phase. This is a crucial step for gathering feedback, addressing concerns, and refining the proposal based on the input of community members and stakeholders.

3. **Voting:**
   - Once the proposal has undergone sufficient discussion and potential revisions, it moves to the voting stage. Token holders participate in a decentralized voting process to determine whether the proposal should be accepted or rejected.

4. **Implementation:**
   - If a FIP receives majority approval through the voting process, the proposed changes are implemented into the Frietor protocol. Implementation may involve updating smart contracts, network parameters, or other relevant components.

5. **Documentation:**
   - After implementation, thorough documentation is provided to the community. This documentation includes details about the executed changes, any potential impacts, and instructions for users and developers adapting to the updated protocol.

### **Key Considerations:**

1. **Decentralization:**
   - The FIP framework is designed to ensure decentralization in decision-making. Community members actively participate in proposing, discussing, and voting on protocol upgrades.

2. **Transparency:**
   - Transparency is a fundamental principle. Each FIP goes through a transparent lifecycle, allowing the community to track its progress, provide feedback, and understand the rationale behind proposed changes.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The FIP framework aims to provide an efficient and streamlined process for coordinating upgrades. The goal is to foster coordination and consensus naturally around proposed changes, ensuring the protocol's continuous improvement.

4. **Community Involvement:**
   - The FIP framework encourages active community involvement in the evolution of Frietor. Through proposals, discussions, and voting, community members play a vital role in shaping the protocol's future.

### **Continuous Improvement:**

The FIP framework is dynamic and subject to improvement. Periodic evaluations, community feedback, and iterative enhancements to the framework ensure that it remains adaptive and responsive to the evolving needs of the Frietor ecosystem.
